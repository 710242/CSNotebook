# file and directory

---

### 1. File System

file system is a arrangement of directories and files. everything starts in the directory called root, whose name is the single character /

The attributes of a file are the thing that describe the file such as size,owner,permission and so on. we can use stat or fstat function to see the attributes of a file. we'll include in future.

### 2. Filename

the file name in UNIX system can only contain letters,numbers,period(.),dash(-) and underscore(_).

two files are automatically created when a directory is created: "." and ".."
respectedly represent current and parent directory

### 3. Pathname

absolute and relative pathname refer to relation of the current directory(or data). the root file system is a special-case absolute pathname

### 4. ls command

```c
#include "apeu.h"
#include "dirent.h"

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    DIR   *dp;
    struct dirent *dirp;

    if(argc != 2)
      err_quit("usage: ls directory_name");

    if((dp = opendir(argv[1])) == NULL)
      err_sys("can't open %s", argv[1]);

    while((dirp = readdir(dp)) != NULL)
      printf("%s\n", dirp->d_name);

    closedir(dp);
    exit(0);
}
```

first we include a file called apeu, which contains many error expection(the function or macro start with "err" often are from apeu.h)

second we check the input and see if we can open it.

and while we can read it, print it out(remember the "." and ".." will alse be printed out)
