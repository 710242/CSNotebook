### uid and gid

user ID(uid) comes from the login behavior and which is assigned by the system adminstrator. we cannot change uid and it is unique to every users.

we call the user whose uid is 0 as root or superuser.

group ID(gid) is alse assigned by the system adminstrator. groups are often used to collect users together into projects or departments. thsi allow sharing resources and files within the same gid.

the group file /etc/group maps group names into gid.

```c
#include "apue.h"

int
main(void)
{
  printf("uid = %d, gid = %d\n", getuid(), getgid());
  exit(0);
}
```
