### open and openat

Both return: file descriptor if OK, âˆ’1 on error

```c
#include <fcntl.h>
int open(const char *path, int oflag, ... /* mode_t mode */ );
int openat(int fd, const char *path, int oflag, ... /* mode_t mode */ );
```

| O_WRONLY | Open for writing only.|
| O_RDWR | Open for reading and writing.|
