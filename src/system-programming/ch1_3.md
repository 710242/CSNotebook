# input and output

---

### 1.file descriptors

file descriptors are the integers that the kernel uses to identify the files accessed by a process.

### 2.standard input output and error

all shells open three file descriptors while a new program runs: standard input output and error.

### 3.unbuffered I/O

unbuffered I/O is provided by functions: open read write lseek and close.
these are all work with file descriptors.

### 4.standard I/O

standard I/O functions provide a buffered interface to the unbuffered I/O functions. using standard I/O rely on users choose buffer size, and it provides functions that let us control the style of buffering used by library.

```c
#include "apue.h"

int
main(void)
{
  int c;
  while((c = getc(stdin)) != EOF)
    if(putc(c, stdout) == EOF)
      err_sys("output error");

  if(ferror(stdin))
    err_sys("input error");

  exit(0);
}
```

this is an example of copy standard input to standard output.

<!-- ### 1. man(manul)

man is a function that teach user how to use the command line, for example:

```bash
$ man ls
```

will show the manuls about the ls commad
