# fcntl function

---

### fnctl

```c
#include <fcntl.h>
int fcntl(int fd, int cmd, ... /* int arg */ );
```

Returns: depends on cmd if OK (see following), −1 on error

### purpose

The fcntl function is used for five different purposes.

1. Duplicate an existing descriptor (cmd = F_DUPFD or F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC)
2. Get/set file descriptor flags (cmd = F_GETFD or F_SETFD)
3. Get/set file status flags (cmd = F_GETFL or F_SETFL)
4. Get/set asynchronous I/O ownership (cmd = F_GETOWN or F_SETOWN)
5. Get/set record locks (cmd = F_GETLK, F_SETLK, or F_SETLKW)

### cmd

| cmd | descriptors |
|-----|-------------|
| F_DUPFD | Duplicate the file descriptor fd. The new file descriptor is returned as the value of the function. It is the lowest-numbered descriptor that is not already open, and that is greater than or equal to the third argument (taken as an integer). The new descriptor shares the same file table entry as fd. (Refer to Figure 3.9.) But the new descriptor has its own set of file descriptor flags, and its FD_CLOEXEC file descriptor flag is cleared. (This means that the descriptor is left open across an exec, which we discuss in Chapter 8.) |
| F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC | Duplicate the file descriptor and set the FD_CLOEXEC file descriptor flag associated with the new descriptor. Returns the new file descriptor. |
| F_GETFD | Return the file descriptor flags for fd as the value of the function. Currently, only one file descriptor flag is defined: the FD_CLOEXEC flag. |
| F_SETFD | Set the file descriptor flags for fd. The new flag value is set from the third argument (taken as an integer). |
| F_GETFL | Return the file status flags for fd as the value of the function. We described the file status flags when we described the open function. They are listed in Figure 3.10. Unfortunately, the five access-mode flags—O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR, O_EXEC, and O_SEARCH—are not separate bits that can be tested. (As we mentioned earlier, the first three often have the values 0, 1, and 2, respectively, for historical reasons. Also, these five values are mutually exclusive; a file can have only one of them enabled.) Therefore, we must first use the O_ACCMODE mask to obtain the access-mode bits and then compare the result against any of the five values. |
| F_SETFL | Set the file status flags to the value of the third argument (taken as an integer). The only flags that can be changed are O_APPEND, O_NONBLOCK, O_SYNC, O_DSYNC, O_RSYNC, O_FSYNC, and O_ASYNC. |
| F_GETOWN | Get the process ID or process group ID currently receiving the SIGIO and SIGURG signals. We describe these asynchronous I/O signals in Section 14.5.2. |
| F_SETOWN | Set the process ID or process group ID to receive the SIGIO and SIGURG signals. A positive arg specifies a process ID. A negative arg implies a process group ID equal to the absolute value of arg. |
