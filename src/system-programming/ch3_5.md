### offset

Every open file has an associated ‘‘current file offset,’’, which

### lseek

```c
#include <unistd.h>
off_t lseek(int fd, off_t offset, int whence);
```

Returns: new file offset if OK, −1 on error

### whence

whence is also a flag similar to oflag

| whence | set offset |
|--------|------------|
| SEEK_SET | offset is set to offset bytes from the beginning thefile. |
| SEEK_CUR | offset is set to its current value plus the offset.
| SEEK_END | offset is set to the size of the file plus the offset. |

The offset can be positive or negative.

> **Note**
> If the file descriptor refers to a pipe, FIFO , or socket, lseek sets errno to ESPIPE and returns −1.
