# file sharing

---

The kernel uses three data structures to represent an open file,

### process table.

Every process has an entry in the process table. within the entry, there's a table of open file descriptors. which we can think of as a vector, with one entry per descriptor, associated with each file descriptor are

### file table

The kernel maintains a file table for all open files.

### v-node

v-node also contains the i-node for the file.

> Why we need a file table entry link to vnode instead same vnode?

since there may have two program open a file at the same time but if both need to write to the file. the node may have the false offset to write(maybe one of the program write successful, but when another try to write, the file is changed ), so we need file table(which have 'current file offset' parameter in it) to help us dodge the error of offset
