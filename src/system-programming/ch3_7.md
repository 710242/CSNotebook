# write function

---

### write

```c
#include <unistd.h>
ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t nbytes);
```

Returns: number of bytes written if OK, âˆ’1 on error

this function is used as an example as unbuffered I/O and the buf means the buffer, the nbytes means the size of that buffer.<br />
when doing write function, we dont need to allocate a space in real memory space since the function is unbuffered and the time we use this function in our program, the system actual write the data into the disk.
