# format

---

before writing the most simple program hello world, i think it's essential to understanding the formatting first.

reference to [Format specifiers in C](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/format-specifiers-in-c) we can see that there are tons of format that fit each type.

| Format Specifier | Type |
|---------|---------|
| %c |	Character |
| %d |	Signed integer |
| %e or %E | Scientific notation of floats |
| %f |	Float values |
| %g or %G | Similar as %e or %E |
| %hi	| Signed integer (short) |
| %hu	| Unsigned Integer (short) |
| %i |	Unsigned integer |
| %l or %ld or %li | Long |
| %lf	| Double |
| %Lf |	Long double |
| %lu |	Unsigned int or unsigned long |
| %lli or %lld |	Long long |
| %llu |	Unsigned long long |
| %o | 8進位 |
| %p | Pointer |
| %s | String |
| %u | Unsigned int |
| %x or %X | 16進位 |
| %n | Prints nothing |
| %% | Prints % character |

one of the notice is the last one, we can see that % is similar to \ , both of which make the origin word transfer to other meaning. we'll describe the \ symbol in next part
